The Pacers-Knicks series had me going back through Reggie Miller's career and it highlighted something that goes a little under the radar - that Reggie Miller is the most efficient first option ever.

Here is how Reggie stacks up against 20 of the best first options in league history, based on total playoff points and efficiency relative to era:

### Efficiency Rankings Table

| Player | Playoff Points | rTS% |
|--------|---|---|
| Reggie Miller | 2895 | 115 |
| Kawhi Leonard | 3133 | 112 |
| Jerry West | 4457 | 110 |
| Stephen Curry | 4147 | 110 |
| Kareem Abdul-Jabbar | 5762 | 109 |
| Kevin Durant | 4985 | 109 |
| Charles Barkley | 2833 | 109 |
| Dirk Nowitzki | 3663 | 108 |

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Kawhi is the Only One Close
Kawhi is the only one that comes quite close. The raw gap between Reggie and even Steph is as big as the gap between Jordan and Kobe.

### 2. Reggie's Prime Was Elite
Reggie obviously has a lower volume than most of these scorers, but if you filter for his prime years from 1991-2002, when he was a 24PPG scorer across 100+ playoff games in a slow era, his rTS was 115. Which would still top the list.

### 3. Longevity and Team Success
Being quite literally the most efficient first option of all-time, with his longevity, with 14 series wins without a single HOF teammate (except a 34yo Chris Mullin), and having led his team to the playoffs 15 times.

### On All-Star Selection

> Wild to think that he's only a 5-time all star. Less than Kyle Lowry or Joe Johnson.

> Guard was a stacked position in the East and Reggie's usage was a lot lower in the regular season than the playoffs. His highest regular season average FGA was 15.4. He has 8 playoff runs with a higher average FGA topping out at 22.5 in the 2000 Finals run.

> not just "guard" either. you have to remember that rosters were constructed by position. sg1 in the east was guaranteed mj, so you only had 1 or 2 other spots.

> East was the better conference until Shaq went west and Jordan retired. Also Reggie was criminally underrated the first 1/3 of his career because the Pacers were a fringe playoff team in a small market. I think Reggie's skills in the modern NBA are maximized and he gets a lot more accolades, and even maybe more playoff succes.

### On Modern Era Comparison

> Reggie was way ahead of his time. Imagine if he was shooting 10 3s a game like players do now? I feel like you could basically transplant him from the 1990s to now and he'd be just as effective if not more so, unlike some players whose games have aged very poorly. He was a statheads player before there were really any statheads.

> Guy's prime was in the late 90s/early 2000s. That's the modern NBA's dead ball era. Even 18ppg was a big deal then, 20+ was actually impressive. With today's pace and a system optimizing his skills Reggie would be a 25ppg+ guy.

### On the Table Sorting Issue

> It's my best attempt at capturing the 20 best playoff scorers. Order is a bit random but criteria for inclusion was mainly based on total playoff points, but exercising some common sense to prioritize including first options like Barkley/Giannis/Jokic over guys like Tony Parker and Scottie, who are high on the list just because of number of playoff games played.

### On Comparing to Other Greats

> Idk Reggie was great for a long time but saying he's more valuable then Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, or Dwyane Wade is wild

**macandcheeser** (10 days ago)
> I don't think Reggie vs Wade is a wild comparison. I'd agree Wade had the higher peak, but Reggie was a stud for a long time, and always available. Reggie is way ahead of Wade in career win shares. Reggie also slightly ahead in WS/48, and VORP. Wade ahead in BPM

> His career playoff rTS is 99 - which is pretty terrible for an all-time big man whose rTS is 109 in the regular season. I do not consider him a better playoff scorer than any of the 20 listed, personally.

### On Efficiency Metrics

**IcyAuthor1** (10 days ago)
> Didn't expect Bird, Giannis, and Duncan to be that low.

**rayrayiscray** (10 days ago)
> Giannis I can understand, his ft% (and high volume of them) really brings down the overall ts% even despite being one of the most efficient 2pt scorers in league history.

**MarkoSeke** (10 days ago)
> TS rewards three point shooters. Also it's not "low", this is a list of the top of all time

### On Jordan's Position on the List

> Still insane to see 6'2" Steph where he is on these lists lol. much true shooting is affected by how good of a 3p shooter you are and Curry being the best, it's pretty insane West is able to match him on more points, without 3p shots even existing.
