# Who are teams in the playoffs that have impressed you?

For me it's the Magic. Despite awful shooting, they have really taken the defending champs to the brink. I'm a little biased as a Duke fan but Paolo and Franz are absolute dogs and my favorite young wing duo in the league those guys have shown they are built for playoff basketball with their shot making ability and competing defensively. I truly hope orl can get those kids some real shooters and a true point guard theirs another level their games and overall team can reach if they simply had some floor spacing and average guard play around them.

### On Randle's Performance

> Ant's been a machine as expected, but Randle's genuinely beating the beyblade allegations and it's so nice to see

> Randle has been a revelation. His bully ball has worked perfectly on offense, and his physically is a big reason LeBron has run out of gas
> (55 upvotes)

> Randle knows he can out muscle most guys one on one, and then makes the correct read when doubles come. He also plays defense with his chest, not hands so he doesn't get the fouls Kat did. Luka and Bron can't just shove Randle out of the way on every drive.

### On the Magic

> Magic have been solid but I wouldn't really call it taking us to the brink. Atlanta a couple years ago was the real scary first round.

> Magic is one of those "if they figure it out, they're gonna be scary" examples. I've been pretty high on them for 2+ seasons. Hoping for health for them next year. They will be a regular conference contender if they get a little more 3pt shooting and continue to ride the growth of Paolo and the Wagners.

> Wolves are not surprising if you had watched them, I had picked them to beat the Lakers in six and was specifically the team I wanted to dodge in the first round the most. The have the highest ceiling of all the teams outside of OKC because they can be both elite offensively and defensively. Their only real flaw is decision making at times, but even then Ant has improved hugely on that end.

> I think they were ultimately under estimated as too many crowned the Lakers as being better than they are actually are. Especially after the OKC H2Hs where their shooting output just wasn't very realistic of who they were in a Playoff setting. I think the next best team is the Clippers, but man they have definitely found ways to lose games against the Nuggets. But ultimately think it's going to end up pretty comfortably a OKC-MIN WCF and that is going to be an insane series.

### On Cade and the Pistons

> Cade. Dude needs to seriously cut down on the turnovers, but he's a bucket.
> (79 upvotes)

**remonnoki** (1 month ago)
> Cade has really impressed with his play but even more so with his leadership. I think Detroid has a maturity and emotion problem which can be buffed out with age and experience. He's holding both himself and his teammates accountable. Him pushing his rookie away yesterday to keep him in check, chill him out and stop him from getting a stupid tech was some real shit.

### On Indiana and Carlisle

> I'm sorry, but you're impressed with... The Magic? Anyway, I hate it but I gotta give credit to Indiana. They impressed me last year too ad honestly, that offense is capable of beating literally everyone lol. not saying they're gonna win it all or anything, but Carlisle and the players deserve massive credit
