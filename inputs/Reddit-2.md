# How is it that the two best teams in the playoffs based on stats, having a chance of playing against each other in the Finals, is considered to be a snoozefest?

Why is the NBA media this biased and terrible at marketing their product to the point the potential of the two best teams in advanced stats in the playoffs is considered to be a "meh" occasion?

NBA is in dire need of a makeover in their PR and Marketing department from the top down if they can't get the "average" person to be interested in a matchup of the two beset teams in the playoffs...

### On Casual Viewers and Star Power

**GunstarGreen** (15 days ago)
> Its a superstars league. Its not Lakers vs Minny, its LeBron vs Antman. They're desperate for superstars yo be in big games. ESPN could be talking about bowling and they'd turn it into a discussion on LeBron. Two teams playing great team ball, one with the "boring" MVP and the other the most overrated player in the game. The media domt know what yo do.

> While I think NBA marketing has something to do with it, you also can't manufacture hype and interest from nothing. This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically great team, or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of players win the last 7 finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating.

### On the NFL Model

**begging_brother** (15 days ago)
> The NFL has absolutely perfected the idea that the entire league as a whole is the product. The Pittsburgh Steelers remain one of the most popular teams in the league, even though the city is quite small and they haven't had stellar success in recent years. The internet is convinced that the NFL is rigging games in favor of Kansas City, the 30th largest media market in the country. Dallas, LA, New York, Miami, Chicago, any of these major markets could be in the Super Bowl and the ratings would be largely on par with a Green Bay vs Buffalo Super Bowl.

### On Player vs Team Fandom

**FMCam20** (15 days ago)
> Outside of my hometown Hawks I don't care about teams but do about players. I'm a Hawks fan but also a Bron, Steph, and Giannis fan and I suspect a lot of basketball fans are the same way where they only care about their hometown team and then are fans of players second so the NBA doesn't promote teams as much as the players. The Warriors will cease to be important once Steph retires for example

### On Player Conduct (SGA and Flopping)

**IfYou Know YouKnowYaNo** (14 days ago)
> SGA is a top 3-5 player in this league. I don't deny him that. He's so good. But it's hard to give him his flowers, celebrate him, or respect him when he chooses to play the game that way, manipulate the system instead of just hoopin honorably and ethically. He could be the MVP without all the stupid flailing, cartoon character as falls, and all the acting. That's the most frustrating part. He's so damn good he doesn't need it, but does all that bitch made shit.

> You think Kobe would be caught doing that shit ever? Bird? Jordan? Kareem? Nash? Shaw? Timmy D? KG? Hellllll fuckin no. They might have drawn fouls, but drawing fouls doing honest moves and taking actual shots attempting to make a bucket is a skill. SGA throwing himself to the ground when someone brushes his arm, and just flinging the ball in the general direction of the hoop is not a skill, it's some bitch ass cheese. Like the kid who won at mortal kombat by spamming the leg sweep or uppercut. Yeah, you won, but everything thinks you're lame as fuck
