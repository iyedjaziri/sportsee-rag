# Which NBA team did not have home court advantage until the NBA Finals?

**Posted on r/nba - December 6, 2025**

In the NHL, the Edmonton Oilers just reached the NHL Finals. In their 3 rounds of play, they did not have home court advantage. They played the Kings on the road. Then the Golden Knights on the road. Then finally, the Stars on the road. They will now host the Panthers at home for the Finals.

Which NBA team experienced this? First 3 rounds all on the road. Finals at home.

> Six teams have made the Finals with lower than a 4 seed and none of them have had home court in the Finals. Think the answer is none, at least in the modern NBA.

> The funny thing was the Nuggets took their foot off the gas after getting a 7 game lead over the 2 seed Grizz and people worried they were throwing away home court in the finals because at least the top 2 seeds in the east had better records. Instead Nuggets faced the Heat lol.

### The Play-In Tournament Debate

**Salty_Watermelon** (12 days ago)
> A 9th or 10th placed team is almost guaranteed to get smashed in the 1st round, and has pretty much no chance of making the Finals. It was cool that the 10th placed Heat made the playoffs until they lost to the Cavs in one of those most uncompetitive series of all time. And the argument that it prevents tanking falls somewhat short when the Mavericks have already tanked to avoid the play-in, and then got rewarded for it by keeping their pick and drafting Lively...

> And the argument that it prevents tanking falls somewhat short. It's not going to prevent teams losing a few games at the end of a season, it's to give teams an incentive to win through march-April when the season hasn't gone so well. Before the play ins, teams just gave up if they were like 5 or more games outside the 8 seed. Now damn near every teams fights for a play in spot or to keep themselves in the 6th seed or above. It has revitalized the last third of the season. Then the play in games themselves are pretty fun too. Play ins have had nothing but positive effects for the NBA. The chances of a 6-8th seed making the Finals is slim. Should we exlude them from the playoffs entirely too? Feels silly to base things off their chances of making the Finals.

> The play-in is worthwhile for its own sake. It's a few mini-Game 7s amongst not-great but not-completely-awful teams which makes for a nice appetizer going into the playoffs. Personally I find it very interesting to see more flawed / average teams being put in that situation as you get to learn things about teams and players you otherwise wouldn't, because they'd either miss the playoffs entirely or get bounced quickly in the first round by a much better team. re: the Mavs, I don't think they tanked, it was actually disastrous for them to miss the playoffs after the Luka trade and it was almost entirely down to injuries. They got lucky in the lottery but we know what their odds were, and it's really not worth tanking out of the play-in for such low odds. A statistical fluke doesn't change that point.

> The main benefit of the play-in is just the fact that it can keep most of the teams hovering around that 6-seed/7-seed boundary in a death race until the very end of the regular season in order to avoid the play-in. Plus 7 and 8 seeds are basically freebie first round series anyways. It's not as if 1 and 2 seeds losing in the first round has ever been particularly common even before the play-in.

> it only exists for an extra 4 games of revenue, but i would not mind if they reverted it to the system from the bubble, where it only kicked in if the teams were within a certain number of games of each other. in 2024, 8-seed Miami won 7 more games than the 9-seed Bulls & this year, the grizzlies won 8 more games than the 9-seed kings. there's absolutely no reason why either of those teams needed to have a play-in game.

### The Historical Perspective

**Tearz_in_rain** (11 days ago)
> You need to 8-5 seeds to make the finals for that to happen. We've seen multiple teams get to the finals without home court at all, the most famous case likely being the Rockets in 95, who won a title and had to beat the teams with the 4 best records in the league to do it. But they never had home court at all. The Knicks did it in the lock-out season in 99 and lost in the finals. The Heat I think did it twice with Jimmy Butler.

> It's harder in basketball because usually the "better team" goes to the finals as basketball has less variance than hockey due to how much harder it is to score in hockey

**areksoo** (12 days ago)
> Never happened. For a team to make the final never having home court advantage you have to be the 5th seed. So the finals, needs a 6th or lower... but that's never happened because every finals contained at least a 1st, 2nd or 3rd seed.

> Never in the NBA. That's because Hockey is the favourite sport of the god of randomness and lower seeds win way more often than in basketball. The NHL also has the same problem as the NBA of having the post-season be so much more intense that it's almost a different sport. What worked for a 110 point President's Trophy winner in the regular season may not work at all in the playoffs.

### Conference Imbalance Theory

> Don't know off the top of my head but I bet this has happened to some Western Conference team when the conferences were truly lopsided.

**yousaytomaco** (12 days ago)
> would really need a very lopsided difference between conference, like in 2008 when Golden State missed the playoffs at 48-34 in the west but the Cavs could be a 5th seed at 45-37. That year, for example, had the Suns and Rockets (both 55-27 and the 6th and 5th seed) made a run (not as crazy as it sounds, the Lakers were 1st at only 57-25), with the Suns going to the finals, and the Magic (52-30) gotten hot and also gone ot the finals, like they did next year, the Suns would have been the lower seed each round until the finals
